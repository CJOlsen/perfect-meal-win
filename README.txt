Perfect Meal

This port (windows) is under temporary copyright.  The GNU/Linux branch is
under the GPLv3.  This version also contains fewer files, only what it needs to
run - the GNU/Linunx branch is where development occurs.


About:

This is a technology preview of Perfect Meal, a program that allows you to
build meals and shows you the nutritional profiles of them.  Special thanks to
Ashley Williams for packaging the USDA database in a JSON format
(http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database) and to the USDA.  You can
also view the USDA version of the database here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/


How to run:

One the lower right side of the https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal-win/
page there is s 'Download Zip' button, it will download the whole thing.  After
download and unzip, there is a file called perfectmeal_gui.exe in the dist
folder, this should "just work".  If it doesn't it should generate an error log
of why it didn't and if you could send that my way it would be appreciated.


Windows Versions Specific:

There are a few .dll files necessary for the program to run that are proprietary
and I'm in the process of figuring out how to either distribute the program
with them or include a link to get them.  This issue prevents distribution under
a free and open license until I can be sure all copyrights are being respected.
Luckily there are no such issues affecting the GNU/Linux version of this program
so it remains under the GPLv3, https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal

Problems:

several.
