IMPORTANT NOTE (Windows users only):

You may need to visit

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29

and download/install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package.  
When running on Windows this program uses some of the underlying Microsoft 
files available in that package.  (But there's a very good chance they're 
already installed in your system.)


About:

This is a pre-release of Perfect Meal, a program that allows you to
build meals and shows you the nutritional profiles of them.  Special thanks to
Ashley Williams for packaging the USDA database in a JSON format
(http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database) and to the USDA.  You can
also view the USDA version of the database here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/

The search algorithms are currently in need of tuning.  (Some of them have
taken a particular liking to entire turkeys..... There have been slightly better
algorithms that didn't survive some of the structural changes of the program.)


How to run:

One the lower right side of the https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal-win/
page there is s 'Download Zip' button, it will download the whole thing.  After
download and unzip, there is a file called perfectmeal_gui.exe in the "dist"
folder, this should open the program.  If it doesn't it should generate an error 
log of why it didn't and if you could send that my way it would be appreciated,
but it isn't expected that you do so.


GNU/Linux users:

Visit https://github.com/CJOlsen/perfect-meal for the current GNU/Linux version,
it's also the main development repository which tends to be ahead of this one.
