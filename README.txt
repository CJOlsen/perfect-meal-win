About:

This is a technology preview of Perfect Meal, a program that allows you to
build meals and shows you the nutritional profiles of them.  Special thanks to
Ashley Williams for packaging the USDA database in a JSON format
(http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database) and to the USDA.  You can
also view the USDA version of the database here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/


How to run:

Copy the entire folder from https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal-win/dist and
run "perfectmeal_gui.exe".  If it doesn't work then please try to let me know.
There are known problems with certain .dll files at this time.


Windows Versions Specific:

There are a few .dll files necessary for the program to run that are proprietary
and I'm in the process of figuring out how to either distribute the program
with them or include a link to get them.  This issue prevents distribution under
a free and open license until I can be sure all copyrights are being respected.
Luckily there are no such issues affecting the GNU/Linux version of this program
so it remains under the GPLv3, https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal

Problems:

several.
