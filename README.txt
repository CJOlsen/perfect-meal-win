See included LICENSE file for full license terms.



IMPORTANT NOTE (Windows users only):

In order to preserve the GNU GPLv3 license while respecting all other copyrights
it isn't at this time feasible to include all needed Microsoft files for this
program to run on Windows machines.  You may need to visit

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29

and download/install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package.  When
running on Windows this program uses some of the underlying Microsoft files that are
under strict and restrictive licenses.  I apologize for the inconvenience.


About:

This is a technology preview of Perfect Meal, a program that allows you to
build meals and shows you the nutritional profiles of them.  Special thanks to
Ashley Williams for packaging the USDA database in a JSON format
(http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database) and to the USDA.  You can
also view the USDA version of the database here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/


How to run:

One the lower right side of the https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal-win/
page there is s 'Download Zip' button, it will download the whole thing.  After
download and unzip, there is a file called perfectmeal_gui.exe in the dist
folder, this should "just work".  If it doesn't it should generate an error log
of why it didn't and if you could send that my way it would be appreciated.


Windows Versions Specific:

There are a few .dll files necessary for the program to run that are proprietary
and I'm in the process of figuring out how to either distribute the program
with them or include a link to get them.  This issue prevents distribution under
a free and open license until I can be sure all copyrights are being respected.
Luckily there are no such issues affecting the GNU/Linux version of this program
so it remains under the GPLv3, https://github.com/cjolsen/perfect-meal

Problems:

several.
